# Battleship
Two players terminal game

This is my first Python project.

To start the game run Main.py

Be careful in inputs: 
- input ship in the format: "a1s" ("a" - ship begining coord along letter axis, "1" - ship begining coord along num axis, "s" - ship direction: one of four "s", "n", "e", "w")
- input coordinates in the format: "a1" ("a" - coord along letter axis, "1" - coord along num axis)
The keyboard case does not matter.

Hope You like this game)
