# BATTLESHIP Two players terminal game

To start the game run Main.py

Then enter players names. 
**If you enter name of the second player "0", your will play against computer HAL 9000 ))**
He is stupid because he randomly hits empty cells.
Maybe in future I add him intelligence) 

Be careful when entering during the game (keyboard case does not matter): 
- input ship in the format: "a1s" ("a" - ship beginning coord along letter axis, "1" - ship beginning coord along num axis, "s" - ship direction: one of four "s", "n", "e", "w")
- input coordinates in the format: "a1" ("a" - coord along letter axis, "1" - coord along num axis)


This is my first Python project.

I hope You like this game)
